2) Explain: The seg fault is a core dump, meaning that we tried to get access to memory that we were not allowed to. The process of filling the array caused %rip to get overwritten, causing a seg fault.   



-----------------------------------------------------------
3) Explain: I do not agree. If for some reason there is not enough space to allocate for an array at runtime, a segfault will occur, even though the array is created on the Heap.
