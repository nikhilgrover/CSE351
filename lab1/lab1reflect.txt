1) Answer in hex: 0x0A0 
-----------------------------------------------------------
2) Answer in decimal: -352 
-----------------------------------------------------------
3) Explain: -1 when converted to hex is 64 bits of 1s, 
whereas 0xFFFFFFFF is a 32-bit value. If the data type were
to be int, there would be no difference, as they would be
truncated to the same size, but that is not specified. So
when being used in bitwise operations, -1 could behave 
differently than 0xFFFFFFFF depending upon the top 32 bits.
